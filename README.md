Knowledge synthesis on the basic of polyhierarchical models with user profiles, a multidimensional rank thesaurus, mapping concepts across topics/profiles/events/contexts with rankings, could boost AI reasoning: better disambiguation, cross-domain analogies, adaptation to thinking styles, and fewer hallucinations. Key for bridging everyday/scientific thought Polyhierarchical knowledge models: we can freely add new dimensions (user profiles, interests, cognitive styles) without breaking the structure. This enables richer personalization and deeper reasoning in AI-driven knowledge and topic recommendation. Flexible, modular, powerful. Central class ProgramType (X users Science/Engineering) connects downward to several UserProfile, InterestFacet, and Subjectclasses. Arrows as rankedRelevance, partOf, and motivatesThrough show the relationships, representing personalization for X users in science and engineering. Multi-dimensional rank thesaurus: UserProfiles converge upon RankTopics, unveiling layered realms, from TheoreticalFoundations, PhilosophicalImplications, science etc. Person A, B, C, D ... stand as exemplars in this relational ontology of knowledge. New ideas could emerge by combining person A innovation focus, person B critical insights, and persons C&D idea production. Collaborative ontology mapping and interdisciplinary dialogue can spark breakthroughs in tech, science, society.
